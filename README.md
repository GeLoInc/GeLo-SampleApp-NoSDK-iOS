# GeLo SampleApp NoSDK iOS

This sample iOS shows how to range Gelo beacons using nothing but Apple's [CoreLocation framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CoreLocation_Framework/_index.html). 

If you want to leverage the [Gelo platform](https://platform.gelosite.com/users/sign_in) for text, audio, and video content; analytics; mapping beacon management; and mapping, then you'll want to use the [GeLoSDK for iOS](https://github.com/GeLoInc/GeLoSDK-iOS).
